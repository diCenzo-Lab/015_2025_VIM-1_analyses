# Variations in carbapenem resistance associated with the VIM-1 metallo-B-lactamase across the order *Enterobacterales*

This repository contains the scripts and input files required to repeat the analyses reported in the associated article.

## 01_Genome_assembly_annotation

This folder contains the overall workflow (workflow.sh) and associated scripts required to repeat the assembly, annotation, and analyses of the six clinical isolates.

## 02_Plasmid_analysis

This folder contains the overall workflow (workflow.sh) and associated scripts, to repeat the analysis shown in Figure 2 of the manuscript.

## 03_ALE_variant_analysis

This folder contains the overall workflow (workflow.sh), to repeat the genomic analysis of the derived isolates obtained following adaptive laboratory evolution in the presence of ertapenem.

## 04_Porin_analysis

This folder contains the overall workflow (workflow.sh) and input files, to repeat the analysis shown in Figure S2 of the manuscript.

## 05_Annotated_genomes

This folder contains the PGAP output for the six clinical isolates, as the genomes were still undergoing processing by NCBI at the time this manuscript was uploaded to bioRxiv and thus were not yet publicly available via NCBI.
